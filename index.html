      <h3> Saint-Germain Football Club,<br>
        commonly referred to as Paris Saint-Germain,<br> Paris,
        Paris SG or simply<br> PSG is a professional football club
        based in Paris, France. They compete in Ligue 1, the top
        division of French football.<br> Winning the World Cup in
        Qatar seems to have been the reason behind Messi's change
        of mentality.<br> Once the only pending career objective had been
        achieved, the Argentine star would no longer value the
        sporting aspect so much, but would now take into account
        other factors.

        Once he had achieved the feat of winning the World Cup,<br> winning
        more titles in France or even another Champions League would not
        motivate him enough.
        However, one of the <br>conditions that would
        have to be met for his return to be possible would
        be for<br> Messi to give up a large part of his salary in
        order to adapt to the current<br> situation of the Catalan
        side and their wage bill. <br>

        Other clubs such as Inter Miami, Newell's Old Boys and
        even Al-Hilal are also interested in landing the 35-year-old star.

  That sentiment was echoed, with one fan adding: "They terminated Aboubakar's contract for this finished fraud." Another joked: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't reach the level of the strong competitive Saudi league."
  Fans were soon to take to social media to mock Ronaldo for his lack of success since arriving in Saudi Arabia.

  One tweeted: "Ronaldo influence. Al-Nassr is being cooked by a mid-table club in Saudi Arabia." Another wrote: "Ronaldo's holding Al-Nassr back. They need a new striker."
  
  A third fan added: "Let's laugh at Ronaldo." Meanwhile, one more commented: "Ronaldo has been awful I'm not going to lie."
  
  The ridicule continued, as another said: "Ronaldo is not even good enough for the Saudi Pro League and he had the nerve to question Erik ten Hag for not starting him every game in the Premier League. Sold his soul and legacy for money. Finished player and fanbase."

      <p>Fans have ripped into "finished fraud" Cristiano Ronaldo as his Al-Nassr move went from bad to worse on Thursday night.
 Ronaldo made his second start for the club aga of the Saudi Super Cup, having joined Al-Nassr on a free transfer at the start of this month. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner was unable to prevent his new side from crashing out of the competition as they fell to a 3-1 defeat in Riyadh. 
  Fans were soon to take to social media to mock Ronaldo for his lack of success since arriving in Saudi Arabia.

 <p> The result was not the only negative for Ronaldo, either, as he was mocked with rival Lionel Messi's celebration during the Super Cup defeat.
  
  Goals from Romarinho, Abderrazak Hamdallah and Muhannad Al-Shanqeeti proved the difference for Al-Ittihad, despite a second half consolation goal from Talisca. Al-Ittihad will now face Al-Fayha in Sunday's final.</p>
